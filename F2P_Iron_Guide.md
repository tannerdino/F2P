## Introduction





### Success Formula
Many skills, such as fishing, cooking, woodcutting, firemaking, and mining have different success chances based on object types, items used, and levels. Most success chances are calculated using the same formula:
![successrate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61213166/117726974-64024780-b1b5-11eb-949e-c22af023a473.PNG)
The *Low* and *High* variables usually vary by skill, object types, and items used. The *lvl* variable is obviously the level.

**Note: This is success chance for each ROLL. Rolls can cascade and or double in certain cases, depending on activity.**

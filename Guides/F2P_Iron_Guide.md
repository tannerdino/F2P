## Introduction

### F2P Motives
F2P requires a huge amount of motivation. Many players have their reasons why they play F2P, but the same answers usually always arise. The answers range from community, to

In order of most impactful, to least impactful:
- The Community

### The Grind
One of the hardest parts of F2P Ironman mode is the amount of time, effort, and dedication needed to reach your goals. If you played with 100% perfect clicks and doing yet only theoretical methods, it's estimated that it will take just under 5000 hours to max a F2P ironman account. However, with realistic methods, it will take around 7000 hours if you're really efficient. One thing to mention, though, is that people don't normally do even the realistic efficient methods, so expect around 9500 hours with "easier" methods. You could say that it's just clicking for very long periods of time, and you would be right in a very simplistic sense; but the fact of the matter is, what is deemed efficient or worthwhile requires focus, a sense of timing, click accuracy, longterm planning AND tons of time.

Learning how to grind or put a significant amount of time into the game is the skill you need most. Efficiency is NOT your most useful tool; it's better to play 50% efficient for 1000 hours and keep going, than to play 100% efficient for 500 hours and burn out. Every player has what they like, and what they don't like; if you genuinely do not enjoy what you're doing, it's probably a good idea to do the next best alternative. However, this doesn't mean you shouldn't give methods a good chance, many players end up enjoying methods after putting a decent chunk of time in; but it ultimately comes down to what you think is best for you. Remember, NO ONE plays 100% efficient, many of the most efficient players choose to not do the most efficient methods.

### Useful tools
There's many things you can use to benifit yourself ingame by either making things objectively easier, or simply nicer or convenient.

#### F2P.wiki and XP Tracking
XP Tracking can substantially help you during long grinds. The most helpful way to track XP is to keep track of your XP/EHP gains per week and month. You can keep track of day or hour gains, but be ready to be discouraged when theres an inevitable day that does not meet your expectations. Week/month gains ensure that any rough days are smoothed out. Trying to get the best XP does NOT mean doing the fastest skills; tracking XP is tracking XP in a particular skill, not overall xp (unless ofcourse you have some sort of overall xp goal). However, looking at overall EHP gains is a pretty good idea, though not always. Everything comes down to what you prefer, and what you're comfortable with.

The best sites to use are F2P.wiki, and TempleOSRS.com. F2P.wiki is an open source Old School RuneScape hiscores for Free-to-play players. It is a fan-made passion project started in October 2017. It will always be 100% ad-free and non-profit, and is constantly updated with the help of the F2P OSRS community.

#### Abusing Runelite
Runelite is an open-source 3rd party client, with an array of plugins. Some plugins are quality of life, some are absolutely overpowered, and some are just weird. Runelite is definitely not needed, but for some methods ingame the benfits are too worthwhile to pass up.

List of Runelite plugins that make the game easier, but are not overpowered:
- **Boosts Information**: Tells you when to drink strength pots.
- **Tile Indicators**: Shows true tile of yourself, and tiles of others.
- **NPC Aggression Time**r: Shows aggro lines.
- **Object Markers**: Marks Objects, such as trees, rocks, ect.
- **Ground Markers**: Marks the ground
- **Clue Scroll**: Tells you how to complete cluescroll, most notably it can tell you hot and cold clue step solutions.
- **Screen Markers**: Mark the screen to help you know where to click, usually only helpful in interfaces.
- **Shortest path (Plugin Hub)**: Mark a point on the map and it will highlight the squares for the best path.
- **NPC Indicators**: Shows monster respawn squares and time.

Overpowered Runelite plguins:
- **Anti Drag**: Allows you to increase the threashold to drag items, allowing you to minimalize misclicks.
- **Entity Hider**: Can allow you to hide npcs/categorized players; really useful for fishing, or any method thats overcrowded by players.
- **World Hopper**: Changing worlds on login screen, and auto hop.
- **GPU**: Increased render distance.
- **Camera**: Increased camera zoom out distance.
- **Menu Entry Swapper**: Make various teleport items left clickable, make buying from shops easy.
- **Custom Left Click Drop (Plugin Hub)**: Dropping specified items is left clickable.
- **Quest Helper (Plugin Hub)**: Tells you how to do quests, where to click, what options to pick during dialogue, ect.

#### OSRS wiki
OSRS Wiki is a perfect place to find information about things ingame, make sure you use the [Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/) and not the [Wikia Fandom](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Old_School_RuneScape_Wiki). If you want to make sure you use the right one, the ingame account management tab has an osrs wiki link. 90% of the questions you have is easily wikiable; however, OSRS wiki can lack specific F2P Meta questions. Most F2P Meta questions can be answered [here](https://www.f2p.wiki/faqs)

### Success Formula
Many skills, such as fishing, cooking, woodcutting, firemaking, and mining use a success chance formula. Keep in mind this is success chance for each ROLL; rolls can cascade and or double in certain cases. Most success chances are calculated using the same formula:

The *Low* and *High* variables usually vary by skill, object types, and items used. The *lvl* variable is obviously the level.

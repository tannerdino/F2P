## Introduction
Introduction will be used to introduce you to important topics and information that are outside the realm of the in-game meta.



### F2P Motives
F2P requires a huge amount of motivation. Many players have their reasons why they play F2P, but the same answers usually always arise: A good sense of community, no obligation to play before membership runs out, no hourlies/dailies, 99's hold more value, the gameplay is simple and straight forward, F2P is nostalgic, there's no end, and plenty more. The biggest reason is the community. Community creates discussion, competition, a drive to uplift others, friendships, and a comfortable place to stay.


### The Grind
One of the hardest parts of F2P Ironman mode is the amount of time, effort, and dedication needed to reach your goals. If you played with 100% perfect clicks and doing yet only theoretical methods, it's estimated that it will take just under 5000 hours to max a F2P ironman account. However, with realistic methods, it will take around 7000 hours if you're really efficient. One thing to mention, though, is that people don't normally do even the realistic efficient methods, so expect around 9500 hours with "easier" methods. You could say that it's just clicking for very long periods of time, and you would be right in a very simplistic sense; but the fact of the matter is, what is deemed efficient or worthwhile requires focus, a sense of timing, click accuracy, longterm planning AND tons of time.

Learning how to consistently grind long hours is what you need most. Efficiency is NOT your most useful tool; it's better to play 50% efficient for 1000 hours and to keep playing, than to play 100% efficient for 500 hours and to burn out. Every player has what they like, and what they don't like; if you genuinely do not enjoy what you're doing, it's probably a good idea to do the next best alternative. However, this doesn't mean you shouldn't give methods a good chance, many players end up enjoying methods after putting a decent chunk of time in; but it ultimately comes down to what you think is best for you. Remember, NO ONE plays 100% efficient, many of the most efficient players choose to not do the most efficient methods.



### EHP - Efficient Hours Played
"EHP" stands for Efficient Hours Played. It's a metric used to track and compare accounts in the least flawed way possible. A common issue with XP is that many skills and account types are faster than others, meaning comparing other accounts to each other using overall XP isnt an accurate comparison of account progression. EHP Is essentially XP, but reduced based on the XP/hr in the given skill/account type. This means faster skills take less EHP to max than slower skills, but at the same time both skill net the same EHP/hr. Because of EHP being as balanced as possible across account types and skills, EHP is a great way to track account progression, and how efficient you're playing. To see your EHP, and the EHP rates, go to [F2P.WIKI](https://www.f2p.wiki/ranks?clear_filters=true)

#### Bonus XP & 0 Time
Bonus XP is used to calc the amount of 0 time XP a player should have. 0 time simply means skills that are trained passively, or in other words, at the same time during other skills. For example, when training combats, you gain 0.33 Hit Points XP per combat XP; this ofcourse means that Hit Points is passive during combats. Furthermore, we can use Bonus XP ratios (e.g. 1.33:1 HP to melees & ranged) to "punish" players that aren't doing efficient methods, yet are getting over EHP. Over EHP methods normally happen like this due to the nature of F2P Iron EHP, it's really efficient to sacrafice some combat xp/hr for better loot. We can punish these evil-doers by calculating the XP they're expected to have in a skill (using ratios), and subtracting their overall EHP by the EHP they missed out on. Its important to note the Bonus XP EHP rates in the calculations CAN be different than the actual EHP rates. [Bonus XP Ratios](https://www.f2p.wiki/ehp#bonus-xp)


### Useful tools
There's many things you can use to benifit yourself ingame by either making things objectively easier, or simply nicer or convenient.



#### F2P.wiki and XP Tracking
XP Tracking can substantially help you during long grinds. The most helpful way to track XP is to keep track of your XP/EHP gains per week and month. You can keep track of day or hour gains, but be ready to be discouraged when theres an inevitable day that does not meet your expectations. Week/month gains ensure that any rough days are smoothed out. Trying to get the best XP does NOT mean doing the fastest skills; tracking XP is tracking XP in a particular skill, not overall xp (unless ofcourse you have some sort of overall xp goal). However, looking at overall EHP gains is a pretty good idea, though not always. Everything comes down to what you prefer, and what you're comfortable with.

The best sites to use are F2P.wiki, and TempleOSRS.com. F2P.wiki is an open source Old School RuneScape hiscores for Free-to-play players. It is a fan-made passion project started in October 2017. It will always be 100% ad-free and non-profit, and is constantly updated with the help of the F2P OSRS community.



#### Abusing Runelite
Runelite is an open-source 3rd party client, with an array of plugins. Some plugins are quality of life, some are absolutely overpowered, and some are just weird. Runelite is definitely not needed, but for some methods ingame the benfits are too worthwhile to pass up.

List of Runelite plugins that make the game easier, but are not overpowered:
- **Boosts Information**: Tells you when to drink strength pots.
- **Tile Indicators**: Shows true tile of yourself, and tiles of others.
- **NPC Aggression Time**r: Shows aggro lines.
- **Object Markers**: Marks Objects, such as trees, rocks, ect.
- **Ground Markers**: Marks the ground
- **Clue Scroll**: Tells you how to complete cluescroll, most notably it can tell you hot and cold clue step solutions.
- **Screen Markers**: Mark the screen to help you know where to click, usually only helpful in interfaces.
- **Shortest path (Plugin Hub)**: Mark a point on the map and it will highlight the squares for the best path.
- **NPC Indicators**: Shows monster respawn squares and time.
- **World Location**: Shows chunk borders

Overpowered Runelite plguins:
- **Anti Drag**: Allows you to increase the threashold to drag items, allowing you to minimalize misclicks.
- **Entity Hider**: Allows you to hide npcs/categorized players; really useful for fishing, or any method thats overcrowded by players.
- **World Hopper**: Changing worlds on login screen, and auto hop.
- **GPU**: Increased render distance.
- **Camera**: Increased camera zoom out distance.
- **Menu Entry Swapper**: Make various teleport items left clickable, make buying from shops easy.
- **Custom Left Click Drop (Plugin Hub)**: Dropping specified items is left clickable.
- **Quest Helper (Plugin Hub)**: Tells you how to do quests, where to click, what options to pick during dialogue, ect.


#### OSRS wiki
OSRS Wiki is a perfect place to find information about things ingame, make sure you use the [Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/) and not the [Wikia Fandom](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Old_School_RuneScape_Wiki). If you want to make sure you use the right one, the ingame account management tab has an osrs wiki link, as well as a wiki banner at the top right of your client and a wiki command in public chat "::wiki". 90% of the questions you have are easily wikiable; however, OSRS wiki can lack specific F2P Meta questions. Most F2P Meta questions can be answered [here](https://www.f2p.wiki/faqs)

## Efficient Max Order

## Tactics & Techniques
Common tactics and techniques that are useful everywhere ingame.
### Tick Manipulation in Skilling
Please check out the [Tick Manipulation Mechanics Guide](https://github.com/data-dependent/osrs-guides/blob/master/skilling.md) by Data_dependant! It explains tick manipulation and its mechanics in tremendous detail; even if you know how tick manipulation works, check it out.

Various Tick manipulation items, and their properties:
| Name | Length | Move in same tick? | Item or Additional Reqs |
|--------|--------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Flinched | ROUNDDOWN(YourAttackSpeed/2) | Not traditionally | Alt, PVP (or npc) |
| Eating | 3 tick | Yes | Food |
| Snow | 3 tick | No | Snow globe (Or reindeer hat) from Christmas events |
| Rune pick | 3 tick (1/6 chance to 2 tick) | No | Rune pick, 41 mining, an adjacent rock |
| Adamant pick | 4 tick (1/6 chance to 3 tick) | No | Adamant pick, 31 mining, an adjacent rock |
| Soft Leather | 4 tick (3 tick + 1 tick interface) | No | Needle, thread, soft leather |
| Tinderbox and log | 4 tick | Yes | Tinderbox and log |

### Prayer Flicking
Prayer Flicking is a useful skill to have if you want to do multiple obor and bryophyta kills per trip, or if you want to save hours for combats. When you activate a prayer, it starts to drain the tick after its activated. This means you can easily turn it on and off before the drain starts. If you have a good understanding of ticks, prayer flicking is pretty intuitive; but, 1 tick prayer flicking can be tricky. [Prayer Flicking](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Prayer#Prayer_flicking) on OSRS Wiki, explains prayer flicking quite well.

**Example of Prayer Flicking**

### Alt Abuse
### Efficient World Hopping
### Run Energy Managment

## Combats
Combat training has the biggest impact over any skill on a F2P Ironman. Law & Nat expense skills and combats rely on each other, the most important drop of which are the law drops. There are 4 main monsters in F2P that give laws: Ogresses, Moss Giants, Hill Giants, and Ankous. Each have their pros and cons. Theres also other monsters that give very little laws such as Mind and Body Golems, Giant Frogs, Chaos Dwarves, Ice Giants, Minotaurs, Demons, ect.

### [Ogresses](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ogress_Warrior)
Ogresses give the most laws out of any of the other monsters. On top of that, they give tons of nats, gems, and gp. However, Ogresses have much higher defence and HP than the other monsters. This means reduced combat XP/hr and less prayer xp in the longrun. Ogresses are killed in the [Cosair Cove.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Corsair_Cove#Corsair_Cove_Dungeon)

### [Moss Giants](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Moss_giant)
Moss Giants give decent laws, nats, and gp. They, additionally, give really good combat XP/hr and solid prayer XP. One thing that really benifits the loot from Moss Giants is the mossy keys. Mossy keys are a one time use to fight [Bryophyta](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bryophyta), the moss giant boss, and they're a really good source of laws, nats, gp, and strength pots. Mossy keys are normally a 1/150 chance (pre-roll); however, at [Wilderness Moss Giants](https://mejrs.github.io/osrs?m=-1&z=3&p=0&x=3139&y=3813&npc=Moss+giant) mossy keys have an additional 1/100 chance to drop when the 1/150 chance fails. This averages to a 1/60.24 chance. Additionally, Bryophyta has a 1/16 chance (pre-roll) to drop a key. So this increases the average keys per Moss Giant even further to a 1/56.475 chance. If you dont want to risk going into the wilderness, Moss Giants in [Varrock Sewers](https://mejrs.github.io/osrs?m=-1&z=4&p=0&x=3165&y=9889&npc=Moss+giant) or [Crandor](https://mejrs.github.io/osrs?m=-1&z=3&p=0&x=2826&y=3239&npc=Moss+giant) is the next best thing.

### [Hill Giants](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hill_Giant_(Desert_Plateau))
Hill Giants give decent laws, nats, and gp. They give decent combat XP/hr, and extremely good prayer XP. Hill Giants also have a giant boss: [Obor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Obor). Obor is the key reason why hill giants have decent laws, nats, and gp. Unlike Moss Giants, Hill Giants do not have a good wilderness spot; in addition, giant keys in the wilderness are a 1/60 chance compared to the 1/56.475 chance of mossy keys. This is okay, however, because Hill Giants at [Desert Plateau](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Desert_Plateau) are really good. Desert Plateau has 7 Hill Giant spawns, as well as 5 bone spawns that take 100 ticks each to respawn; that means if you were to pick up those bone spawns perfectly during hill giant killing, it'd be an additional 1350 prayer XP/hr, just from the bone spawns alone. Alternatively, you could do Hill Giants in the [Edgeville Dungeon](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Edgeville_Dungeon#Southern), which is good for using giant keys during trips; however, theres more people there and the Hill Giants are more spread-out

### Efficient Melee Order
Each melee skill increases [DPS](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Damage_per_second/Melee), in a variety of ways; each attack lvl gained increases accuracy, every X number of strength lvls gained increases max hit, and each defence lvl gained increases trip time (if no prayer flick). The order of which you train attack, strength, and defence becomes the question. The solution is quite simple; if the hours saved from a gained attack lvl, before progressing strength lvls to the next max hit, is greater than the hours saved from training that next attack lvl with a new max hit, then its better to train attack in that case; else, it's better to train strength. Using the [MeleeOrder funtion](2) I made, I've compiled a lot of melee orders for each monster.

Data from this confirms

### Monster Percentages
When deciding what to kill for combats, a dilemma occurs: Ogresses give too many laws for smithing and crafting, but not enough laws for rc; and everything else doesn't give enough laws for smithing. What we need is a percentage of ogresses and monster2 needed for the perfect amount of laws. However, we need to figure out which skills are worth to spend laws on first. For a rough estimate, we can look at the increase in xp/hr per law used for each skill.
- Rc: 0.00% (~0.25% - 0.44% UIM & HCIM)
- Smith: ~0.30% (0.33% UIM)
- Crafting: ~3.00%

Keep in mind, in order to precisely find the answer, we'd need to look at hours saved per law, which is a lot of math work as a lot of skills depend on each other. A rough estimate gives us enough evidence to assume that smithing and crafting are prioritized over runecrafting, assuming you play efficiently on a normal ironman account. On UIM's and HCIM's, prioritizing runecrafting over smithing doesn't lose you a significant amount of time, compared to how much time you lose on a normal iron. [Suicide bodies]() is the reason why law rc on ironman isnt as good. Smithing also gives a significant amount of magic xp, as stated in [smithing]().

Assuming we're prioritizing smithing and crafting over runecrafting, we can use this simple formula to determine the Monster2:Ogress ratio. With this ratio, we can very easily determine the percentage of both monsters.
![Bigformula](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61213166/117911432-c8073780-b2ab-11eb-8951-7dc6c4680ea1.png)
Where:
- *x = monster2's per Ogress*
- *O = Ogress*
- *m = monster2*
- *C = Crafting xp needed to goal*
- *S = Smith xp needed to goal*
- *D = Combat xp needed to goal*
- *c = craft per kill*
- *h = health*
- *n = nats per kill*
- *l = laws per kill*


## Law & Nat Expense Skills
Mentioned earlier in [Combats](#combats), law and nature runes are THE most important runes on a F2P Ironman. They speed up skills like [Smithing](#smithing), [Crafting](#crafting), and [Runecrafting](#runecrafting) to a large degree. 

### Smithing
Smithing is one of the most useful skills on a F2P Ironman. You can smith from mithril axes (50 smithing) to rune axes (85 smithing) for [woodcutting](#woodcutting--firemaking), a rune scimitar (89 smithing) for [Melees](#combats), or any sort of unique items like rune daggers (84 smithing) or war hammers (94 smithing). For smithing, iron ore is ALWAYS meta; if your goal is purely XP or GP, theres no reason to not do iron. Iron reaches a success rate of 100% at 61 mining, meaning it can't get any faster after 61 mining. This fact becomes particularly useful for [crafting]().


#### Smithing Experience Rates
The exact Hours depends greatly on what monster you kill for combats, so it will be under the assumption that combats were trained efficiently.
| Method | XP rate | Smith Hours | Hours to 99 all |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Raw Superheat | 27000 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | - |
| Raw Snow Superheat | 30000 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | - |
| Double Hop Snow Superheat | 0 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | 0 hours |
| Double Hop Superheat | 0 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | 0 hours |
| Standard Hop Snow Superheat | 0 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | 0 hours |
| Standard Hop Superheat | 0 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | 0 hours |
| 3 tick Rings of Forging | 0 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | 0 hours |
| 3.5 tick Rings of Forging | 0 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | 0 hours |
| Standard Rings of Forging | 0 xp/hr | 0 xp/hr | 0 hours |



#### Superheating
Superheating is the most efficient way to train smithing; you gain fast smithing XP/hr, and tons of passive magic XP. The best ore to superheat is always iron, any other ore is a complete waste. One may think that superheating steel-runite saves nature runes, therefore its efficient. However, superheating anything else but iron is slower than non-superheat iron methods; in other words, if you wont superheat iron, its better to not use your nats.

##### Obtaining Nature Runes
There are 2 main ways of obtaining nature runes: killing monsters, and telegrrabbing nats.

##### Using Nature Runes

#### Rings of Forging
Rings of forging is great alternative over superheating

### Crafting
Crafting has a high XP rate ceiling; it is pretty much impossible to perfect tick efficient crafting. This is mainly due to an ample amount of world hopping. The most efficient way to gain crafting XP is to

### Runecrafting
Runecrafting is by far the slowest skill on a F2P Ironman; it's effective limit is only around 5.5k-6k/hr. However, theres dozens of distinct runecrafting methods, in which, earth and body runes are primarily the best and easiest to do. Runecrafting is almost always the best skill to lamp

## Quick Skills
Fishing, cooking, woodcutting, and firemaking are the fastest skills on a F2P Ironman. All of these skills have their own range of leniency in terms of mechanics, alternatives, and max order placement.

### Success Formula
Many skills, such as fishing, cooking, woodcutting, firemaking, and mining use a success chance formula. Keep in mind this is success chance for each ROLL; rolls can cascade and or double in certain cases. Most success chances are calculated using the same formula:
![successrate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61213166/117903966-845a0100-b29e-11eb-8230-b63d5e5a4550.png)
The *Low* and *High* variables usually vary by skill, object types, and items used. The *lvl* variable is obviously the level.

[A List of Low and High Variables](https://github.com/tannerdino/F2P/blob/e0f25e168e279b8ccf2b99293cfd4c8575b2d14b/Additional%20Info/Lows%20and%20Highs)

### Fishing & Cooking
Fishing and Cooking are pretty much the same skill. Trout and salmon are the best fishing xp, which are found at [Barbarian Village]() and Lumbridge. When fishing trout and salmon, from lvls 20-99 you can expect to use roughly 222,160 feathers averaging 58.63 xp per feather. Your cooking to fishing xp ratio will be on average 1.3353:1, putting you at 9,757,940 fishing xp once you hit 99 fishing; once there, you can do cookless fishing. Lumbridge is always better than Barbarian Village; believe it or not, Lumbridge fish spawns are considerably closer to each other, making lumbridge ~0.68% faster in just raw rates. However, some people prefer Barbarian Village over Lumbridge, due to the eternal fire there. There's a large assortment of [Tick Manipulation]() methods for fishing. But, all of them are beat out by one method called "Erie fishing."

3 tick fish 0 time cook is a key part of Erie fishing. Eating increases the skilling timer by 3 ticks, we can abuse this by eating right as the tick cycle is over continuing it as a "3 tick cycle". When cooking, if you only have one of a particular fish type, you can cook it in 1 tick; on top of that, you can cook in the same tick that you eat, without interupting eating. Note that, in F2P, eating is the only way to 3 tick fish 0 time cook; other ways to 3 tick in F2P, like auto retaliate and snow, are a lot more strict compared to eating. Auto retaliate doesn't actually create a 3 tick cycle, it just changes your skilling timer to half your attack speed (rounded down), and requires no interaction meaning you cannot cook in time or at the same time. Similarly with snow, you cannot cook in the same tick you start a 3 tick cycle with snow making snow essentially redundant.

During this method, you do not want to "react" to getting a fish; knowing exactly when your next fish is key to this method. Precise timing makes the clicks easy. Remember you can use your xp drops as a good way to keep your self in a rhythm (Set them to slower by right clicking on xp orb!) 

 
 
#### 4 tick fish 0 time cook
4 tick fish 0 time cook is the last ingredient to Erie fishing. When you're doing 3 tick fish 0 time cook, you eventually run out of fish to eat due to the chance of an unsuccessful roll. In order to get fish back without eating, the next best thing is to use either leather, a way to 4 tick. This method is considerably easier to time, and doesn't require as many clicks as 3 tick fish 0 ti[me cook. If you do this method to replace Erie fishing, you only lose around 43 hours in total.<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Y8wu1jTATBFSiHFs8m/giphy.gif" alt='3 tick fish 0 time cook' width=450>

 
 
#### Erie Fishing
Erie fishing is 3 tick fish 0 time cook, and 4 tick fish 0 time cook combined. As explained in [4 tick fish 0 time cook](#4-tick-fish-0-time-cook), you use 4 tick fish to replenish the food you lose from 3 tick fishing. Erie Fishing is hard, but anyone can learn it. I recommend checking out the full [Erie Fishing Guide](2) I made, and also these youtube videos:

#### Fishing Alternatives
 
### Woodcutting & Firemaking
Much like Fishing and Cooking, Woodcutting and Firemaking are very closely tied together. The 2 best trees for Woodcutting are yews and willows; willows being the fastest, and yews being the AFK alternative. Any other trees are completely negligable. Woodcutting and Firemaking are one of the most diverse skills in terms of methods and alternatives. Methods ranging from AFKing yews to 2.66 tick willows with 0 time firemake. You can choose whichever method fits your ideals. The main "restriction" for Woodcutting is axe type availability; you can obtain axe types bronze through steel via shops, but axe types mithril through rune, must be obtained through smithing. Most notably, adamant at 70 and rune at 85 smithing. Axe types increase your success rates at each tree type, ditching smithing and using lower lvl axe types comes at a price.
 
#### Firemaking & Complexities
Standard firemaking is relatively simple; you chop logs until you have a full inventory, then you firemake all the logs without missing ticks. Standard firemaking is an extremely viable and worthwhile way to train firemaking, however firemake ultimately slows down woodcutting. This means that the more you firemake, the more time you aren't woodcutting. This factor significantly rewards methods that have high XP per log; or even, 0 time Firemake methods
 
#### Perfect Tick Rates
Looking at these rates, we can see that 0 time Firemake saves tons of time over standard firemaking. Yew trees are less affected by axe-type, compared to willows. Yews with standard firemake are also pretty comparable to willows, since yews have a high XP per log, as stated in [Firemaking & Complexities](Firemaking--Complexities). Keep in mind, these rates are *Perfect tick*, which means rates for hard or intense methods are more unrealistic to reach than easier methods.

#### Multiple Snow Piles
Each 8x8 game chunk has a 1 snow limit. This means that you can have 2 adjacent snow piles next to each other, where chunks meet. This is useful because you cannot spawn a snow on the tick after it disapears, you really need that tick in order to maintain a constant 3 tick cycle. 

![unknown (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61213166/120356925-db1d8e00-c2d2-11eb-88f2-87512c1afc9a.png)

Snow takes 7 ticks to spawn once you activate your snowglobe and snow lasts on the ground for 24 ticks, this means we can easily time our snow globe activation on the correct tick. This wording makes it seem precise, but in reality its hardly precise.


#### 3 tick willows 
Using [Multiple Snow Piles](#multiple-snow-piles), we can do a method dubbed "Double Snow." Double Snow takes 242 hours to 99 wcing, if doing standard firemaking. This can be lowered to 176 hours if you do 0 time firemake

## Introduction


### The Grind
One of the hardest parts of F2P Ironman mode is the amount of time, effort, and dedication needed to reach your goals. If you played with 100% perfect clicks and doing yet only theoretical methods, it's estimated that it will take just under 5000 hours to max a F2P ironman account. However, with realistic methods, it will take around 7000 hours if you're really efficient. One thing to mention, though, is that people don't normally do even the realistic efficient methods, so expect around 9500 hours with "easier" methods. You could say that it's just clicking for very long periods of time, and you would be right in a very simplistic sense; but the fact of the matter is, what is deemed efficient, or worthwhile requires focus, senses of timing, accuracy, and longterm planning. Not to mention the amount of time required.

Learning how to grind or put a significant amount of time into the game is the skill you need most. Efficiency is NOT your most useful tool; it's better to play 50% efficient for 1000 hours and keep going, than to play 100% efficient for 500 hours and burn out. Every player has what they like, and what they don't like; if you genuinely do not enjoy what you're doing, it's probably a good idea to do the next best alternative. However, this doesn't mean you shouldn't give methods a good chance, many players end up enjoying methods after putting a decent chunk of time in; but it ultimately comes down to what you think is best for you. Remember, NO ONE plays 100% efficient, many of the most efficient players choose to not do the most efficient methods.




### Success Formula
Many skills, such as fishing, cooking, woodcutting, firemaking, and mining use a success chance formula. Keep in mind this is success chance for each ROLL; rolls can cascade and or double in certain cases, depending on activity. Most success chances are calculated using the same formula:

The *Low* and *High* variables usually vary by skill, object types, and items used. The *lvl* variable is obviously the level.

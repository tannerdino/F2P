## Introduction
Introduction will be used to introduce you to important topics and information that are outside the realm of the in-game meta.



### F2P Motives
F2P requires a huge amount of motivation. Many players have their reasons why they play F2P, but the same answers usually always arise: A good sense of community, no obligation to play before membership runs out, no hourlies/dailies, 99's hold more value, the gameplay is simple and straight forward, F2P is nostalgic, there's no end, and plenty more. The biggest reason is the community. Community creates discussion, competition, a drive to uplift others, friendships, and a comfortable place to stay.


### The Grind
One of the hardest parts of F2P Ironman mode is the amount of time, effort, and dedication needed to reach your goals. If you played with 100% perfect clicks and doing yet only theoretical methods, it's estimated that it will take just under 5000 hours to max a F2P ironman account. However, with realistic methods, it will take around 7000 hours if you're really efficient. One thing to mention, though, is that people don't normally do even the realistic efficient methods, so expect around 9500 hours with "easier" methods. You could say that it's just clicking for very long periods of time, and you would be right in a very simplistic sense; but the fact of the matter is, what is deemed efficient or worthwhile requires focus, a sense of timing, click accuracy, longterm planning AND tons of time.

Learning how to consistently grind long hours is what you need most. Efficiency is NOT your most useful tool; it's better to play 50% efficient for 1000 hours and to keep playing, than to play 100% efficient for 500 hours and to burn out. Every player has what they like, and what they don't like; if you genuinely do not enjoy what you're doing, it's probably a good idea to do the next best alternative. However, this doesn't mean you shouldn't give methods a good chance, many players end up enjoying methods after putting a decent chunk of time in; but it ultimately comes down to what you think is best for you. Remember, NO ONE plays 100% efficient, many of the most efficient players choose to not do the most efficient methods.



### EHP - Efficient Hours Played
"EHP" stands for Efficient Hours Played. It's a metric used to track and compare accounts in the least flawed way possible. A common issue with XP is that many skills and account types are faster than others, meaning comparing other accounts to each other using overall XP isnt an accurate comparison of account progression. EHP Is essentially XP, but reduced based on the XP/hr in the given skill/account type. This means faster skills take less EHP to max than slower skills, but at the same time both skill net the same EHP/hr. Because of EHP being as balanced as possible across account types and skills, EHP is a great way to track account progression, and how efficient you're playing. To see your EHP, and the EHP rates, go to [F2P.WIKI](https://www.f2p.wiki/ranks?clear_filters=true)

#### Bonus XP & 0 Time
Bonus XP is used to calc the amount of 0 time XP a player should have. 0 time simply means skills that are trained passively, or in other words, at the same time during other skills. For example, when training combats, you gain 0.33 Hit Points XP per combat XP; this ofcourse means that Hit Points is passive during combats. Furthermore, we can use Bonus XP ratios (e.g. 1.33:1 HP to melees & ranged) to "punish" players that aren't doing efficient methods, yet are getting over EHP. Over EHP methods normally happen like this due to the nature of F2P Iron EHP, it's really efficient to sacrafice some combat xp/hr for better loot. We can punish these evil-doers by calculating the XP they're expected to have in a skill (using ratios), and subtracting their overall EHP by the EHP they missed out on. Its important to note the Bonus XP EHP rates in the calculations CAN be different than the actual EHP rates. [Bonus XP Ratios](https://www.f2p.wiki/ehp#bonus-xp)


### Useful tools
There's many things you can use to benifit yourself ingame by either making things objectively easier, or simply nicer or convenient.



#### F2P.wiki and XP Tracking
XP Tracking can substantially help you during long grinds. The most helpful way to track XP is to keep track of your XP/EHP gains per week and month. You can keep track of day or hour gains, but be ready to be discouraged when theres an inevitable day that does not meet your expectations. Week/month gains ensure that any rough days are smoothed out. Trying to get the best XP does NOT mean doing the fastest skills; tracking XP is tracking XP in a particular skill, not overall xp (unless ofcourse you have some sort of overall xp goal). However, looking at overall EHP gains is a pretty good idea, though not always. Everything comes down to what you prefer, and what you're comfortable with.

The best sites to use are F2P.wiki, and TempleOSRS.com. F2P.wiki is an open source Old School RuneScape hiscores for Free-to-play players. It is a fan-made passion project started in October 2017. It will always be 100% ad-free and non-profit, and is constantly updated with the help of the F2P OSRS community.



#### Abusing Runelite
Runelite is an open-source 3rd party client, with an array of plugins. Some plugins are quality of life, some are absolutely overpowered, and some are just weird. Runelite is definitely not needed, but for some methods ingame the benfits are too worthwhile to pass up.

List of Runelite plugins that make the game easier, but are not overpowered:
- **Boosts Information**: Tells you when to drink strength pots.
- **Tile Indicators**: Shows true tile of yourself, and tiles of others.
- **NPC Aggression Time**r: Shows aggro lines.
- **Object Markers**: Marks Objects, such as trees, rocks, ect.
- **Ground Markers**: Marks the ground
- **Clue Scroll**: Tells you how to complete cluescroll, most notably it can tell you hot and cold clue step solutions.
- **Screen Markers**: Mark the screen to help you know where to click, usually only helpful in interfaces.
- **Shortest path (Plugin Hub)**: Mark a point on the map and it will highlight the squares for the best path.
- **NPC Indicators**: Shows monster respawn squares and time.

Overpowered Runelite plguins:
- **Anti Drag**: Allows you to increase the threashold to drag items, allowing you to minimalize misclicks.
- **Entity Hider**: Allows you to hide npcs/categorized players; really useful for fishing, or any method thats overcrowded by players.
- **World Hopper**: Changing worlds on login screen, and auto hop.
- **GPU**: Increased render distance.
- **Camera**: Increased camera zoom out distance.
- **Menu Entry Swapper**: Make various teleport items left clickable, make buying from shops easy.
- **Custom Left Click Drop (Plugin Hub)**: Dropping specified items is left clickable.
- **Quest Helper (Plugin Hub)**: Tells you how to do quests, where to click, what options to pick during dialogue, ect.


#### OSRS wiki
OSRS Wiki is a perfect place to find information about things ingame, make sure you use the [Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/) and not the [Wikia Fandom](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Old_School_RuneScape_Wiki). If you want to make sure you use the right one, the ingame account management tab has an osrs wiki link, as well as a wiki banner at the top right of your client and a wiki command in public chat "::wiki". 90% of the questions you have are easily wikiable; however, OSRS wiki can lack specific F2P Meta questions. Most F2P Meta questions can be answered [here](https://www.f2p.wiki/faqs)

## Efficient Max Order

## Tactics & Techniques

## Combats
Combat training has the biggest impact over any skill on a F2P Ironman. Law & Nat expense skills and combats rely on each other, the most important drop of which are the law drops. There are 4 main monsters in F2P that give laws: Ogresses, Moss Giants, Hill Giants, and Ankous. Each have their pros and cons. Theres also other monsters that give very little laws such as Mind and Body Golems, Giant Frogs, Chaos Dwarves, Ice Giants, Minotaurs, Demons, ect.

### [Ogresses](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ogress_Warrior)
Ogresses give the most laws out of any of the other monsters. On top of that, they give tons of nats, gems, and gp. However, Ogresses have much higher defence and HP than the other monsters. This means reduced combat XP/hr and less prayer xp in the longrun. Ogresses are killed in the [Cosair Cove.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Corsair_Cove#Corsair_Cove_Dungeon)

### [Moss Giants](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Moss_giant)
Moss Giants give decent laws, nats, and gp. They, additionally, give really good combat XP/hr and solid prayer XP. One thing that really benifits the loot from Moss Giants is the mossy keys. Mossy keys are a one time use to fight [Bryophyta](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bryophyta), the moss giant boss, and they're a really good source of laws, nats, gp, and strength pots. Mossy keys are normally a 1/150 chance (pre-roll); however, at [Wilderness Moss Giants](https://mejrs.github.io/osrs?m=-1&z=3&p=0&x=3139&y=3813&npc=Moss+giant) mossy keys have an additional 1/100 chance to drop when the 1/150 chance fails. This averages to a 1/60.24 chance. Additionally, Bryophyta has a 1/16 chance (pre-roll) to drop a key. So this increases the average keys per Moss Giant even further to a 1/56.475 chance. If you dont want to risk going into the wilderness, Moss Giants in [Varrock Sewers](https://mejrs.github.io/osrs?m=-1&z=4&p=0&x=3165&y=9889&npc=Moss+giant) or [Crandor](https://mejrs.github.io/osrs?m=-1&z=3&p=0&x=2826&y=3239&npc=Moss+giant) is the next best thing.

### [Hill Giants](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hill_Giant_(Desert_Plateau))
Hill Giants give decent laws, nats, and gp. They give decent combat XP/hr, and extremely good prayer XP. Hill Giants also have a giant boss: [Obor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Obor). Obor is the key reason why hill giants have decent laws, nats, and gp. Unlike Moss Giants, Hill Giants do not have a good wilderness spot; in addition, Giant keys in the wilderness are a 1/60 chance compared to the 1/56.475 chance of mossy keys. This is okay, however, because Hill Giants at [Desert Plateau](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Desert_Plateau) are really good. Desert Plateau has 7 Hill Giant spawns, as well as 5 bone spawns that take 100 ticks each to respawn; that means if you were to pick up those bone spawns perfectly during hill giant killing, it'd be an additional 1350 prayer XP/hr, just from the bone spawns alone. Alternatively, you could do Hill Giants in the [Edgeville Dungeon](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Edgeville_Dungeon#Southern), which is good for using giant keys during trips; however, theres more people there and the Hill Giants are more spread-out

### Formulas & Solutions
The question arises: What is the best monster to kill? The solution is quite simple actually, it's a mix of Ogresses and Hill Giants. 42.54% Ogresses, 57.46% Hill Giants to be exact.

First, we need to figure out which skills are worth to spend laws on. For a rough estimate, we can look at the increase in xp/hr per law used.
Rc: 0.00% (0.25% - 0.44% UIM & HCIM)
Smith: ~0.30% (0.33% UIM)
Crafting: ~3.00%
Keep in mind, in order to precisely find the answer, we'd need to look at hours saved per law, which is a lot of math work as a lot of skills depend on each other. A rough estimate gives us enough evidence to assume that smithing and crafting are prioritized over runecrafting, assuming you play efficiently on a normal ironman account. On UIM's and HCIM's, prioritizing runecrafting over smithing doesn't lose you a significant amount of time, compared to how much time you lose on a normal iron. This is mainly due to the passive magic xp from smithing.


Assuming smithing and crafting are a priority, we need to find the laws needed. However, this isn't simple because depending on what monster we kill, the 0 time craft and smith affects the laws needed.

### Success Formula
Many skills, such as fishing, cooking, woodcutting, firemaking, and mining use a success chance formula. Keep in mind this is success chance for each ROLL; rolls can cascade and or double in certain cases. Most success chances are calculated using the same formula:
![successrate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61213166/117903966-845a0100-b29e-11eb-8230-b63d5e5a4550.png)
The *Low* and *High* variables usually vary by skill, object types, and items used. The *lvl* variable is obviously the level.
